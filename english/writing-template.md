One primary reason / factor is that $\blank$. For instance, $\blank$ (specific example / evidence) demonstrates how $\blank$ (topic) can facilitate $\blank$ (positive effect) or Moreover, this situation is often derived from $\blank$ (related factor), which exerts a formidable influence on $\blank$ (subject). However, without proper regulation / restraint, it may impair $\blank$ (negative aspect) or deviate from its intended purpose.

In conclusion, $\blank$ is a complex and intricate issue that requires coherent consideration. By exerting efforts to blance $\blank$ (positive aspects) and subordinate challenges, society can achieve $\blank$ (desired goal).
